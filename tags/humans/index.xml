We (together with Kimmo Kaski, Aalto University) are organizing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eccs2011.eu/&#34;&gt;ECCS&#39;11&lt;/a&gt; Satellite conference &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Complex Dynamics of Human Interactions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to be held at Vienna, September 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to have a map of the structure. It is crucial to understand the dynamics of a process”&lt;/em&gt;, L. Barábasi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;
The nature of human interaction has undergone a substantial change in the past years and the change does not seem to be over. Technologies like email, smart-phones, social networks like Facebook or broadcast technologies like Twitter transform the way people keep in touch and new trends of communication appear: individuals are continuously connected with each other, social activities are commonly shared by groups of people and people do not need to be geographically close to stay connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high availability of digital data about human activity given by these communication channels and their high detail has provided unprecedented understanding of the nature of humans interactions, that affect the very definition of social relationships, hubs, communities and their role on society. Particular important is the role that human dynamics has in processes that happen concurrently with the dynamics of interaction, like information/disease epidemics in social networks, opinion dynamics, coordination, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this meeting is to explore the dynamical structure of social and communication networks and the role of the human complex dynamics in realistic processes like information spreading, personal recommendation or &amp;ldquo;word-of-mouth&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific topics of interest are (but not only):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  * High Frequency analysis of communication and social networks
  * Causality and correlation in human communication patterns
  * Reality Mining, Face-to-Face interactions
  * Modeling dynamics of human interactions
  * Applications to viral marketing, infection spreading, opinion dynamics.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Relationship mining</title>
      <link>https://estebanmoro.org/2010/01/relationship-mining/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each day trillions of emails, phone calls, comments on blogs, twitter messages, exchanges in online social networks, etc. are done. Not only the number of communications has increased, but also each of these transactions leaves a digital trace that can be recorded to reconstruct our high-frequency human activity. It is not only the amount and variety of data that is recorded what is important. Also its high-frequency character and its comprehensive nature have allowed researchers, companies and agencies to investigate individual and group dynamics at an unprecedented level of detail and applied them to client modeling, organizational analysis or epidemic spreading [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for technical or privacy reasons only the existence but not of the content of those exchanges is known. Thus we can quantify the intensity and frequency of the interaction but not its type. For decades, social science has measured relationships between individuals in the currency of tie strength, introduced by Granovetter [1]. Weak ties (loose acquaintances) can help to disseminate ideas and/or innovations between different groups, help to find a job or new information; while strong ties (family, trusted friends) hold together organizations and social groups and can affect emotional health. Despite its success to explain these phenomena, tie strength of human relationships is vaguely defined in most large-scale social empirical work. Specifically, relationships are generally quantified by the intensity or duration of communication, although they are known to have significant drawbacks as tie strength predictor [3,4]. Multiplexity, rhythm and depth of the communication seem to be better predictors of tie strength than intensity [4]. Incorporating those metrics in the data mining of online communication might improve the definition of relationships between individuals and in turn transform our understanding of individual dynamics and its impact in our lives, organizations and society [5]. The challenge is to unveil social relationships in social media and not just mere interactions between individuals, which in general over-represent the real structure of a social group [6] (see figure). And this is of paramount importance to understand the propagation of ideas, opinions, commercial messages, etc. in social networks, since most links declared in social networks might be meaningless from a relationship point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The speed and reach of forwarded emails, rumors, and hoaxes in electronic social networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://estebanmoro.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/large_spain_5-300x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;large_spain_5&#34;&gt;
We have just published an &lt;a href=&#34;http://estebanmoro.org/2009/08/impact-of-human-activity-patterns-on-the-dynamics-of-information-diffusion/&#34;&gt;experimental/theoretical work&lt;/a&gt; on the speed of information diffusion in social networks in Physical Review Letters. Specifically we have studied the impact of the heterogeneity of human activity in propagation of emails, rumors, hoaxes, etc. Tracking email marketing campaigns, executed by IBM Corporation in 11 European countries, we were able to compare their viral propagation with our theory (see below the campaigns details).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are very simple. Let me give you an example: the typical time between two emails sent by the same person is around 1 day. Traditional models of information diffusion will then yield to an infection speed of 1 day. However, some email computer viruses spread widely in a matter of hours (minutes, sometimes), while some viral propagation (for example the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/25/technology/25HOAX.html&#34;&gt;Veuve-Clicquot hoax&lt;/a&gt;) last for years. How can that occur? The reason is that traditional models are not correct because they neglect the large heterogeneity in the frequency of human activity: the average time between emails (1 day) does not actually represent the collectivity. In fact, most of us respond very quickly to emails, but some take a lot of time to do it. This fact (known and discovered previously by others) has a profound consequence in the way information spreads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  1. When information spreads &amp;quot;successfully&amp;quot;, in the sense that it propagates and reaches most of the collectivity (i.e. it surpasses the [tipping-point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point)), its propagation speed of is determined by the people that have higher activity.
  2. However, when information reaches just a small fraction of the population (below the tipping-point), its propagation is controlled by those who take a lot of time to respond/forward and the spreading is very slow.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, as explained in our paper, has consequences for viral marketing, fads and hoaxes diffusion or opinion dynamics because the speed of their messages propagation depends strongly on the size of the sub-communities of very active and not-so active people. For example, in our campaigns (which were below the tipping-point yet successful from a viral marketing perspective), endogenous propagation of the commercial message lasted for months while the average time between getting the message and forwarding was only 1 day. We also found that messages do not “go viral”: They are viral because of the diffusion mechanism they use, but their spreading success largely depends on the social network propensity and heterogeneous behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, our work has some consequences for the way we model and understand human dynamics, since it shows that there is no such a thing as a typical time scale in the human dynamics. This is in sharp contrast with epidemic models, information diffusion models, etc. in which the heterogeneity in human activity and frequency is usually neglected, in favor of a more homogeneous picture of the activity of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the empirical data: The viral marketing campaigns were conducted by IBM using the typical &amp;ldquo;refer-a-friend&amp;rdquo; mechanism which led to the endogenous diffusion of information. The campaigns’ offerings were promoted at the IBM. homepage where initial participants heard about them. Their primary marketing objective was to generate subscriptions to the company’s on-line newsletter. Subscriptions were entered through a form located in the campaign main web page (a.k.a. registration page). Additionally, a viral propagation mechanism accessible through a button located at the registration page was available to foster the message propagation. The button caption enticed visitors to recommend the page to friends and colleagues by offering, as additional incentive for people to forward the page, tickets for a prize draw to win a laptop computer. More technical details about the campaign can be found at Appendix D of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0641&#34;&gt;arXiv version &lt;/a&gt;of our paper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
We study the impact of human activity patterns on information diffusion. To this end we ran a viral email experiment involving 31183 individuals in which we were able to track a speciﬁc piece of information through the social network. We found that, contrary to traditional models, information travels at an unexpectedly slow pace. By using a branching model which accurately describes the experiment, we show that the large heterogeneity found in the response time is responsible for the slow dynamics of information at the collective level. Given the generality of our result, we discuss the important implications of this ﬁnding while modeling human dynamical collective phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Humans are superdiffusive</title>
      <link>https://estebanmoro.org/2006/02/humans-are-superdiffusive/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2006 07:31:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://estebanmoro.org/2006/02/humans-are-superdiffusive/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When tea is poured in a cup of hot water, we observe a phenomenon called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion&#34;&gt;diffusion&lt;/a&gt;: in the end particles of tea spread evenly throughout the mass of water and we enjoy our cup of tea. Diffusion occurs as a result of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics&#34;&gt;second law of thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt; (increase of entropy) and can be modeled quantitatively using the diffusion equation (or heat equation). This is a funny equation, since it establishes that the velocity of spreading is infinite while the mean root square fluctuations of the position of the particles grows in time as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \langle x^2 \rangle  = 2 D t$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this means that the typical volume covered by the particles of tea in the cup grows like the square root of time, while there is always a chance to find a particle anywhere in the cup. The coefficient &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; is called the diffusion constant and depends on thermodynamical properties of the liquid. It was &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein&#34;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; in his miraculous year (1905) who found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_relation&#34;&gt;relationship with temperature&lt;/a&gt; and mobility of particles in the liquid which is named after him. There are numerous examples of diffusion processes (also known as Brownian motions) from the erratic motion of particles in water found by the botanist Brown in 1827 to the description of price fluctuations in stock markets made by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier&#34;&gt;Bachelier&lt;/a&gt; in 1900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/baggage.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everything in nature is diffusive. Actually, diffusive behavior is related to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CentralLimitTheorem.html&#34;&gt;Central Limit Theory&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that the mean root square fluctuations is growing linearly in time is telling us that the sum of the kicks than a particle of coffee suffers in the cup add like random numbers to get the CLT result: the variance grows linearly in time. The ubiquity of diffusive behavior is related to the fact that convergence in CLT does not depend on the microscopic details of the random numbers that are summed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7075/full/nature04292.html&#34;&gt;recent study published in Nature&lt;/a&gt; and made by D. Brockmann, L. Hufnagel and T. Geisel, these researchers have obtained quantitative assessment of the displacements of humans by analyzing the circulation of bank notes in the United States obtained in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wheresgeorge.com/&#34;&gt;Where is George?&lt;/a&gt; website. They observe that human travel is somehow a random process governed by super-diffusive jumps to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\langle x^2 \rangle = 2 D_1 t$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which says that the typical area covered by humans when traveling is linear in time. This behavior is nothing unexpected, since humans tend to mix short travels around their neighborhood with business or holiday travels. The authors study several statistical properties of the travel of humans to find that it can be described by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.weizmann.ac.il/ESER/People/Brian/CTRW/&#34;&gt;Continuous Time Random Walk &lt;/a&gt;(CTRW). Their study can be relevant to any other thing carried by humans, like viruses or diseases and thus it pertains to epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;

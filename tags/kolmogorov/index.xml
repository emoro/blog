      <description>&lt;p&gt;Take a coin and toss it a number &lt;code&gt;\(N\)&lt;/code&gt; of times in a time interval of duration &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;. Suppose that every time you get head you win &lt;code&gt;\(a\)&lt;/code&gt; euros and that you lose the same amount of money when you get tail. Then your capital is a random process with ups and dows like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
![](/img/posts/figurebachelier.jpg)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is a stochastic process usually called &amp;ldquo;Random Walk&amp;rdquo; and its properties depend on the parameters $N, a $ and &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;. For example: if we play this game several times, the average mean value of the capital obtained after a time &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; is zero! This is simple to realize since the probability to get either head or tails is the same. The problem comes when you analyze the fluctuations around this zero gain: the variance of the deviations from this zero mean behavior go like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ Var(N) = N a^2 $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which brings the sad conclusion that the more times you play the game the higher the fluctuations are. If you are risk-averse, this is the worst situation since, although in average you don&amp;rsquo;t lose or win, the uncertanty of what quantity you will get in one shot of the game is growing in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now ask the following question: do the properties of this game change if we play &lt;code&gt;\(M &amp;gt; N\)&lt;/code&gt; times in the same time &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; with a smaller payoff &lt;code&gt;\(b&amp;lt;a\)&lt;/code&gt;? Of course the stochastic process change, but some of the properties remain unchanged under proper choices of &lt;code&gt;\(a\)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\(b\)&lt;/code&gt;. Obviously the average gain of this new game is also zero. What about the RMS? Note that if we take &lt;code&gt;\(a^2=T/N\)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\(b^2 = T/M\)&lt;/code&gt; then we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\(Var(N) = N a^2 = T\)&lt;/code&gt; for the first game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\(Var(M)  =M b^2 = T\)&lt;/code&gt; for the second game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is independent of the payoff. This fact led some mathematicians early last century to study the asymptotic case &lt;code&gt;\(a\to 0\)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\(N \to \infty\)&lt;/code&gt;, BUT taking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$a^2 N = T = constant \qquad (1)$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which usually called Brownian Motion. The name &amp;ldquo;Brownian&amp;rdquo; comes from the botanist Brown who observed how particles of (probably) &lt;a href=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/2008/12/browns-observations-on-brownian-motion/&#34;&gt;clay moved in water under the kicks of the molecules of water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/louis_bachellier.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bachelier (1870-1946 right) was the first one to study the Brownian motion in his PhD thesis at the Sorbonne in Paris and applied it as a possible model for the stock market. He was well ahead of his time not only for its application to the stock market, but also because he derived a lot of the properties of this stochastic process. Unfortunately his notation was a little bit sloppy. In particular, the dependence of &lt;code&gt;\(a^2\)&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;\(N\)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; [given by equation (1) above] in the limit &lt;code&gt;\(N\to\infty\)&lt;/code&gt; was omitted in most of his books and papers but always assumed by Bachelier. This &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; omission and a careless reading of Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s work was the origin of Paul Lévy&amp;rsquo;s strong criticism to his work. It was so strong, that Levy wrote a very critical and negative report about Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s work when the latter was trying to get an appointment at Dijon. Bachelier of course didn&amp;rsquo;t get the position and moved then to a small university at Besançon and kept on working without much impact in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was after Kolmogorov&amp;rsquo;s 1931 citation of Bachelier work that Lévy went back to his work and realized that he made a misjudgment of Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s work. Apparently Levy didn&amp;rsquo;t even read Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s papers and books in the very first place and, even so, he disregarded Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s findings as erroneous. Quite a strange behavior for one of the best mathematicians of all times. After that, in 1931, Lévy wrote to Bachelier a letter apologizing for his behavior. It was a little bit late since Bachelier retired in 1937 although Bachelier was quite happy to receive Lévy&amp;rsquo;s letter. At last his work was read by someone, and by the best!&lt;/p&gt;

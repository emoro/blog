      <description>Percentage of active users in the Internet 2.0 is tiny. Fractions go from
 * only 1% of Wikipedia&#39;s users contribute to making it better * only 0.1% of users upload their own videos to Youtube * only 3% of people with weblogs post on a daily basis * only 1% of Amazon.com customers contribute with reviews  The numbers are tiny. But not uncommon. Typical return rates of marketing campaigns or surveys are around 2-5% (see report by the Direct Marketing Association).</description>

In particular this implies that not even the mean response time is finite. Hey! why should you then expect me to answer your emails within my lifetime period!</description>

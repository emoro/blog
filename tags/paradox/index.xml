      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve heard it: people that invest on the stock market or that gamble in lotteries, casinos, etc usually say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going through a bad patch&amp;rdquo; (or bad spell). That is, they have been losing money for a while, but hey! better times are ahead and there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to quit. Are they sure? Are better times ahead? How close is &amp;ldquo;ahead&amp;rdquo; to today? Let&amp;rsquo;s work through a specific example to see how far is &amp;ldquo;ahead&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Although the public transportation system in Madrid is very good, I don&amp;rsquo;t usually take the bus or the train to move around. But sometimes my car decides I should take public transportation (bus or train). One of things I always found intriguing is that I always wait way more for the bus than what is expected according to the frequency quoted by the transportation companies at the bus or train stop.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve heard it: people that invest on the stock market or that gamble in lotteries, casinos, etc usually say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going through a bad patch&amp;rdquo; (or bad spell). That is, they have been losing money for a while, but hey! better times are ahead and there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to quit. Are they sure? Are better times ahead? How close is &amp;ldquo;ahead&amp;rdquo; to today? Let&amp;rsquo;s work through a specific example to see how far is &amp;ldquo;ahead&amp;rdquo;. Suppose we play a fair game: we toss a coin and with probability 1/2 we get $1 (heads) and with probability 1/2 we lose $1 (tails). We play the game &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; times and compute our capital &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; up to time &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt;. If our initial capital is zero, then we expect that our capital fluctuate around zero as the coin-tossing game goes on. Sometimes we will be in the &amp;ldquo;winning area&amp;rdquo;, where our capital is positive &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; 0. However, we can also be in the &amp;ldquo;losing area&amp;rdquo; in which our capital is negative &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; 0. If we are going through a bad patch (being in the losing area) we expect that waiting long enough we will recover and come back to the winning area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is incorrect. Let me show you why: let&amp;rsquo;s use some mathematics. Suppose that &lt;code&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/code&gt; is the gain (+$1) or lose (-$1) in toss &lt;code&gt;\(i\)&lt;/code&gt; of the coin. Since our coin is fair, then &lt;code&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/code&gt; is a random number which takes +1 or -1 with equal probability (1/2). Thus the capital up to time &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; is the sum of those random numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$C(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; is then the sum of &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; equally distributed random numbers. In other contexts, &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; is also know as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk&#34;&gt;random walk&lt;/a&gt;. We can apply the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers&#34;&gt;law of large numbers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem&#34;&gt;central limit theorem&lt;/a&gt; to know something about &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the expected value of &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\mathbb{E}[C(n)] = 0$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as expected, since it is a fair game. Thus we have equal probability of being winning or losing at time &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; fluctuates wildly around zero and in fact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$Var[C(n)] = n$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus our capital at time &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; is mostly in an interval of area &lt;code&gt;\(\sqrt{n}\)&lt;/code&gt; around zero, as shown in the next graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
![](/img/posts/cn.jpg)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphs shows 4 realizations of the game (colors) and the lines are the &lt;code&gt;\(\sqrt{n}\)&lt;/code&gt; areas in which our capital is mostly expected. As we can see in the &amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; game, we starting losing money, but after a while we recover and went back to the &amp;ldquo;winning area&amp;rdquo;. Now the question is: what is the probability that we are in the winning area? Specifically, what is the probability &lt;code&gt;\(P(\alpha)\)&lt;/code&gt; that we are in the winning area ($C(n)$ &amp;gt; 0) for a fraction &lt;code&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/code&gt; of the total &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; turns? The naive reasoning in the introduction will tell us that since &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; is fluctuating around zero we expect that the probability will be peaked and 1/2 and thus half of the time we will be in a bad patch and half of the time we will be going through a good spell. Thus, if we are going through a bad patch, we have only to wait to come back to black numbers. However, this is not true. The probability &lt;code&gt;\(P(\alpha)\)&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.berkeley.edu/~chr/teach/Lec14_2006.pdf&#34;&gt;worked out&lt;/a&gt; (although not trivially) to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$P(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{\alpha(1-\alpha)}}$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/pdfa.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the limit &lt;code&gt;\(n\to \infty\)&lt;/code&gt;, which is known as the&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.unl.edu/~sdunbar1/Teaching/MathematicalFinance/Lessons/CoinTossing/ExcessHeads/excessheads.shtml&#34;&gt; arc-sine law&lt;/a&gt; (since the cumulative distribution of &lt;code&gt;\(P(\alpha)\)&lt;/code&gt; is the arc-sin function). As the plot in the right shows the probability is peaked at 1 and 0 (actually, it diverges there!). Thus, for most of the realizations of the game we are most of the time in the winning area or in the losing area. This means that our naive reasoning above does not work: if you expect to recover from a bad patch, your chances are very small. This is obvious if we look at the colored figure above: the orange and black trajectories do not change from one winning/losing area to the other and, apart from the initial steps of the game, they remain in the winning/losing areas forever. The explanation for this behavior is that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/~genovese/class/iprob-S06/notes/lec5-calcs.pdf&#34;&gt;first return time&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; to zero is oftenly large. Actually, its expected time is infinite, which means that once you get into the positive/negative area you remain (mostly) there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note however, that there is no paradox in what we have found and the fact that &lt;code&gt;\(\mathbb{E}[C(n)] = 0\)&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;\(P(\alpha)\)&lt;/code&gt; is symmetric around &lt;code&gt;\(\alpha = 1/2\)&lt;/code&gt; and thus if we play the game a large number of times, on average, we have the same chances of winning and losing. But not for an individual game in which mostly we will be in a bad or good patch forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the moral? Simple: if you get into a bad patch, leave the game. Because chances to recover from a bad patch are small.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waiting for the bus</title>
      <link>https://estebanmoro.org/post/2009-01-28-waiting-for-the-bus/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2009 10:54:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://estebanmoro.org/post/2009-01-28-waiting-for-the-bus/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the public transportation system in Madrid is very good, I don&amp;rsquo;t usually take the bus or the train to move around. But sometimes my car decides I should take public transportation (bus or train). One of things I always found intriguing is that I always wait way more for the bus than what is expected according to the frequency quoted by the transportation companies at the bus or train stop. For example: if the frequency of the buses is 4 per hour, you should expect a bus each 15 minutes on average, although fluctuations around this value may occur due to traffic conditions. Thus, arriving at the bus stop at random will get you an average of 15/2 = 7.5 minutes of wait. I have the impression I always wait 15 minutes instead. How can this be? Is it that I am so unlucky I always arrive at the bus stop when the previous bus has just left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is the famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://mahalanobis.twoday.net/stories/3486587/&#34;&gt;waiting time paradox&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory&#34;&gt;queueing theory&lt;/a&gt;: in short, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the times between two buses are given by the variable &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;. In the ideal world, &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; will be a deterministic variable. In the example above, &lt;code&gt;\(T = 15\)&lt;/code&gt; minutes. However, due to traffic conditions and other variables, &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; is distributed around 15 minutes. For example, the following graphic shows the &amp;ldquo;lateness&amp;quot;of non-frequent buses in Great Britain, extracted from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/public/buspunctuality/buspunctuality07&#34;&gt;Bus Punctuality Statistics GB 2007 report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/lateness1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, although most of the buses were late only less than a couple of minutes, but there is an significant fraction of them that were late more than 5 minutes. And even some of them came earlier than expected! Assuming that our buses come at times &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;drawn from the above distribution, let&amp;rsquo;s see how a day will look like from the bus stop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/diabus.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buses arrived at the bus stop (vertical lines) with time between them given by &lt;code&gt;\(T_i\)&lt;/code&gt;. After my car breaks down, I arrive at the bus stop at the time given by the vertical arrow. Thus I have to wait a time &lt;code&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/code&gt;. The question is: what is the average value of &lt;code&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/code&gt;? Given that my car breaks at random, I can assume that my arrival time is completely at random, uncorrelated with bus time tables. However, if the time I get to the bus stop is random, I have more probability to get to the bus stop in an interval in which the time between buses &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; is bigger. Specifically, the probability that I arrive at an interval with time between buses &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\frac{T P(T)}{\overline{T}}$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{T}\)&lt;/code&gt; is the average value of time between buses. Given the interval &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;, the waiting time &lt;code&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/code&gt; is equally distributed (since my arrival is random), and thus we have to multiply the above probability by &lt;code&gt;\(1/T\)&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, we average over all possible &lt;code&gt;\(\tau \leq T\)&lt;/code&gt;, giving
&lt;code&gt;$$Q(\tau) = \int_\tau^\infty \frac{TP(T)}{\overline T} \frac{1}{T}dT = \frac{1}{\overline T}\int_\tau^\infty P(T) dT$$&lt;/code&gt;
which give us the distribution of waiting times. The average value of &lt;code&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/code&gt;is the given by
$$\overline \tau = \int_0^\infty \tau Q(\tau) d\tau = \frac{\overline{T^2}}{2\overline T^2} = \frac{\overline T}{2}\left(1 + \frac{\sigma_T^2}{\overline{T}^2}\right) $$
where &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T^2\)&lt;/code&gt; is the variance of the times between buses. This equation is the main result. It says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If buses come at perfect and regular time intervals, then &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T = 0\)&lt;/code&gt; and the waiting time is what we expect: &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{\tau} = \overline{T}/2\)&lt;/code&gt;. That is if we expect a bus each 15 minutes, I will wait (in average) 7.5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, in real world, buses do not arrive at perfect times and then &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T &amp;gt; 0\)&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, waiting time is always greater than &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{T}/2\)&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, the distribution of lateness above shows that there is a large fraction of buses with long delays and then &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T\)&lt;/code&gt; could be very big, controlling the waiting time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the GB Bus Punctuality Report shows that in average, waiting time exceeds 40% the expected time &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{T}/2\)&lt;/code&gt;. That is: due to the variance in times between buses, you (and me) end up waiting a time greater than the average time between buses. And that is my feeling: if trains/buses come each 15 minutes, I end up waiting 15 minutes, not 7.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a ideal world, bus timetables would quote both the frequency of the buses &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{T}\)&lt;/code&gt; and their variance &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T\)&lt;/code&gt;, so we can estimate the waiting time. Unfortunately, they just tell us part of the story&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

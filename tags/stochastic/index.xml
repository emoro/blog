&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; The spontaneous formation of droplets via dewetting of a thin fluid film from a solid substrate allows materials nanostructuring. Often, it is crucial to be able to control the evolution, and to produce patterns characterized by regularly spaced droplets. While thermal fluctuations are expected to play a role in the dewetting process, their relevance has remained poorly understood, particularly during the nonlinear stages of evolution that involve droplet formation. Within a stochastic lubrication framework, we show that thermal noise substantially influences the process of droplets formation. Stochastic systems feature a smaller number of droplets with a larger variability in size and space distribution, when compared to their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we discuss the influence of stochasticity on droplet coarsening for asymptotically long times.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The speed and reach of forwarded emails, rumors, and hoaxes in electronic social networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://estebanmoro.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/large_spain_5-300x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;large_spain_5&#34;&gt;
We have just published an &lt;a href=&#34;http://estebanmoro.org/2009/08/impact-of-human-activity-patterns-on-the-dynamics-of-information-diffusion/&#34;&gt;experimental/theoretical work&lt;/a&gt; on the speed of information diffusion in social networks in Physical Review Letters. Specifically we have studied the impact of the heterogeneity of human activity in propagation of emails, rumors, hoaxes, etc. Tracking email marketing campaigns, executed by IBM Corporation in 11 European countries, we were able to compare their viral propagation with our theory (see below the campaigns details).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are very simple. Let me give you an example: the typical time between two emails sent by the same person is around 1 day. Traditional models of information diffusion will then yield to an infection speed of 1 day. However, some email computer viruses spread widely in a matter of hours (minutes, sometimes), while some viral propagation (for example the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/25/technology/25HOAX.html&#34;&gt;Veuve-Clicquot hoax&lt;/a&gt;) last for years. How can that occur? The reason is that traditional models are not correct because they neglect the large heterogeneity in the frequency of human activity: the average time between emails (1 day) does not actually represent the collectivity. In fact, most of us respond very quickly to emails, but some take a lot of time to do it. This fact (known and discovered previously by others) has a profound consequence in the way information spreads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  1. When information spreads &amp;quot;successfully&amp;quot;, in the sense that it propagates and reaches most of the collectivity (i.e. it surpasses the [tipping-point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point)), its propagation speed of is determined by the people that have higher activity.
  2. However, when information reaches just a small fraction of the population (below the tipping-point), its propagation is controlled by those who take a lot of time to respond/forward and the spreading is very slow.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, as explained in our paper, has consequences for viral marketing, fads and hoaxes diffusion or opinion dynamics because the speed of their messages propagation depends strongly on the size of the sub-communities of very active and not-so active people. For example, in our campaigns (which were below the tipping-point yet successful from a viral marketing perspective), endogenous propagation of the commercial message lasted for months while the average time between getting the message and forwarding was only 1 day. We also found that messages do not “go viral”: They are viral because of the diffusion mechanism they use, but their spreading success largely depends on the social network propensity and heterogeneous behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, our work has some consequences for the way we model and understand human dynamics, since it shows that there is no such a thing as a typical time scale in the human dynamics. This is in sharp contrast with epidemic models, information diffusion models, etc. in which the heterogeneity in human activity and frequency is usually neglected, in favor of a more homogeneous picture of the activity of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the empirical data: The viral marketing campaigns were conducted by IBM using the typical &amp;ldquo;refer-a-friend&amp;rdquo; mechanism which led to the endogenous diffusion of information. The campaigns’ offerings were promoted at the IBM. homepage where initial participants heard about them. Their primary marketing objective was to generate subscriptions to the company’s on-line newsletter. Subscriptions were entered through a form located in the campaign main web page (a.k.a. registration page). Additionally, a viral propagation mechanism accessible through a button located at the registration page was available to foster the message propagation. The button caption enticed visitors to recommend the page to friends and colleagues by offering, as additional incentive for people to forward the page, tickets for a prize draw to win a laptop computer. More technical details about the campaign can be found at Appendix D of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0641&#34;&gt;arXiv version &lt;/a&gt;of our paper&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The probability of going through a bad patch</title>
      <link>https://estebanmoro.org/2009/04/the-probability-of-going-through-a-bad-patch/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2009 11:37:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://estebanmoro.org/2009/04/the-probability-of-going-through-a-bad-patch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve heard it: people that invest on the stock market or that gamble in lotteries, casinos, etc usually say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going through a bad patch&amp;rdquo; (or bad spell). That is, they have been losing money for a while, but hey! better times are ahead and there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to quit. Are they sure? Are better times ahead? How close is &amp;ldquo;ahead&amp;rdquo; to today? Let&amp;rsquo;s work through a specific example to see how far is &amp;ldquo;ahead&amp;rdquo;. Suppose we play a fair game: we toss a coin and with probability 1/2 we get $1 (heads) and with probability 1/2 we lose $1 (tails). We play the game &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; times and compute our capital &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; up to time &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt;. If our initial capital is zero, then we expect that our capital fluctuate around zero as the coin-tossing game goes on. Sometimes we will be in the &amp;ldquo;winning area&amp;rdquo;, where our capital is positive &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; 0. However, we can also be in the &amp;ldquo;losing area&amp;rdquo; in which our capital is negative &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; 0. If we are going through a bad patch (being in the losing area) we expect that waiting long enough we will recover and come back to the winning area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is incorrect. Let me show you why: let&amp;rsquo;s use some mathematics. Suppose that &lt;code&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/code&gt; is the gain (+$1) or lose (-$1) in toss &lt;code&gt;\(i\)&lt;/code&gt; of the coin. Since our coin is fair, then &lt;code&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/code&gt; is a random number which takes +1 or -1 with equal probability (1/2). Thus the capital up to time &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; is the sum of those random numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$C(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; is then the sum of &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; equally distributed random numbers. In other contexts, &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; is also know as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk&#34;&gt;random walk&lt;/a&gt;. We can apply the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers&#34;&gt;law of large numbers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem&#34;&gt;central limit theorem&lt;/a&gt; to know something about &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the expected value of &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\mathbb{E}[C(n)] = 0$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as expected, since it is a fair game. Thus we have equal probability of being winning or losing at time &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; fluctuates wildly around zero and in fact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$Var[C(n)] = n$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus our capital at time &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; is mostly in an interval of area &lt;code&gt;\(\sqrt{n}\)&lt;/code&gt; around zero, as shown in the next graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
![](/img/posts/cn.jpg)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphs shows 4 realizations of the game (colors) and the lines are the &lt;code&gt;\(\sqrt{n}\)&lt;/code&gt; areas in which our capital is mostly expected. As we can see in the &amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; game, we starting losing money, but after a while we recover and went back to the &amp;ldquo;winning area&amp;rdquo;. Now the question is: what is the probability that we are in the winning area? Specifically, what is the probability &lt;code&gt;\(P(\alpha)\)&lt;/code&gt; that we are in the winning area ($C(n)$ &amp;gt; 0) for a fraction &lt;code&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/code&gt; of the total &lt;code&gt;\(n\)&lt;/code&gt; turns? The naive reasoning in the introduction will tell us that since &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; is fluctuating around zero we expect that the probability will be peaked and 1/2 and thus half of the time we will be in a bad patch and half of the time we will be going through a good spell. Thus, if we are going through a bad patch, we have only to wait to come back to black numbers. However, this is not true. The probability &lt;code&gt;\(P(\alpha)\)&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.berkeley.edu/~chr/teach/Lec14_2006.pdf&#34;&gt;worked out&lt;/a&gt; (although not trivially) to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$P(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{\alpha(1-\alpha)}}$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/pdfa.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the limit &lt;code&gt;\(n\to \infty\)&lt;/code&gt;, which is known as the&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.unl.edu/~sdunbar1/Teaching/MathematicalFinance/Lessons/CoinTossing/ExcessHeads/excessheads.shtml&#34;&gt; arc-sine law&lt;/a&gt; (since the cumulative distribution of &lt;code&gt;\(P(\alpha)\)&lt;/code&gt; is the arc-sin function). As the plot in the right shows the probability is peaked at 1 and 0 (actually, it diverges there!). Thus, for most of the realizations of the game we are most of the time in the winning area or in the losing area. This means that our naive reasoning above does not work: if you expect to recover from a bad patch, your chances are very small. This is obvious if we look at the colored figure above: the orange and black trajectories do not change from one winning/losing area to the other and, apart from the initial steps of the game, they remain in the winning/losing areas forever. The explanation for this behavior is that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/~genovese/class/iprob-S06/notes/lec5-calcs.pdf&#34;&gt;first return time&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;\(C(n)\)&lt;/code&gt; to zero is oftenly large. Actually, its expected time is infinite, which means that once you get into the positive/negative area you remain (mostly) there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note however, that there is no paradox in what we have found and the fact that &lt;code&gt;\(\mathbb{E}[C(n)] = 0\)&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;\(P(\alpha)\)&lt;/code&gt; is symmetric around &lt;code&gt;\(\alpha = 1/2\)&lt;/code&gt; and thus if we play the game a large number of times, on average, we have the same chances of winning and losing. But not for an individual game in which mostly we will be in a bad or good patch forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the moral? Simple: if you get into a bad patch, leave the game. Because chances to recover from a bad patch are small.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waiting for the bus</title>
      <link>https://estebanmoro.org/post/2009-01-28-waiting-for-the-bus/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2009 10:54:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://estebanmoro.org/post/2009-01-28-waiting-for-the-bus/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the public transportation system in Madrid is very good, I don&amp;rsquo;t usually take the bus or the train to move around. But sometimes my car decides I should take public transportation (bus or train). One of things I always found intriguing is that I always wait way more for the bus than what is expected according to the frequency quoted by the transportation companies at the bus or train stop. For example: if the frequency of the buses is 4 per hour, you should expect a bus each 15 minutes on average, although fluctuations around this value may occur due to traffic conditions. Thus, arriving at the bus stop at random will get you an average of 15/2 = 7.5 minutes of wait. I have the impression I always wait 15 minutes instead. How can this be? Is it that I am so unlucky I always arrive at the bus stop when the previous bus has just left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is the famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://mahalanobis.twoday.net/stories/3486587/&#34;&gt;waiting time paradox&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory&#34;&gt;queueing theory&lt;/a&gt;: in short, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the times between two buses are given by the variable &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;. In the ideal world, &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; will be a deterministic variable. In the example above, &lt;code&gt;\(T = 15\)&lt;/code&gt; minutes. However, due to traffic conditions and other variables, &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; is distributed around 15 minutes. For example, the following graphic shows the &amp;ldquo;lateness&amp;quot;of non-frequent buses in Great Britain, extracted from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/public/buspunctuality/buspunctuality07&#34;&gt;Bus Punctuality Statistics GB 2007 report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/lateness1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, although most of the buses were late only less than a couple of minutes, but there is an significant fraction of them that were late more than 5 minutes. And even some of them came earlier than expected! Assuming that our buses come at times &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;drawn from the above distribution, let&amp;rsquo;s see how a day will look like from the bus stop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/diabus.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buses arrived at the bus stop (vertical lines) with time between them given by &lt;code&gt;\(T_i\)&lt;/code&gt;. After my car breaks down, I arrive at the bus stop at the time given by the vertical arrow. Thus I have to wait a time &lt;code&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/code&gt;. The question is: what is the average value of &lt;code&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/code&gt;? Given that my car breaks at random, I can assume that my arrival time is completely at random, uncorrelated with bus time tables. However, if the time I get to the bus stop is random, I have more probability to get to the bus stop in an interval in which the time between buses &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; is bigger. Specifically, the probability that I arrive at an interval with time between buses &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\frac{T P(T)}{\overline{T}}$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{T}\)&lt;/code&gt; is the average value of time between buses. Given the interval &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;, the waiting time &lt;code&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/code&gt; is equally distributed (since my arrival is random), and thus we have to multiply the above probability by &lt;code&gt;\(1/T\)&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, we average over all possible &lt;code&gt;\(\tau \leq T\)&lt;/code&gt;, giving
&lt;code&gt;$$Q(\tau) = \int_\tau^\infty \frac{TP(T)}{\overline T} \frac{1}{T}dT = \frac{1}{\overline T}\int_\tau^\infty P(T) dT$$&lt;/code&gt;
which give us the distribution of waiting times. The average value of &lt;code&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/code&gt;is the given by
$$\overline \tau = \int_0^\infty \tau Q(\tau) d\tau = \frac{\overline{T^2}}{2\overline T^2} = \frac{\overline T}{2}\left(1 + \frac{\sigma_T^2}{\overline{T}^2}\right) $$
where &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T^2\)&lt;/code&gt; is the variance of the times between buses. This equation is the main result. It says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If buses come at perfect and regular time intervals, then &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T = 0\)&lt;/code&gt; and the waiting time is what we expect: &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{\tau} = \overline{T}/2\)&lt;/code&gt;. That is if we expect a bus each 15 minutes, I will wait (in average) 7.5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, in real world, buses do not arrive at perfect times and then &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T &amp;gt; 0\)&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, waiting time is always greater than &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{T}/2\)&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, the distribution of lateness above shows that there is a large fraction of buses with long delays and then &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T\)&lt;/code&gt; could be very big, controlling the waiting time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the GB Bus Punctuality Report shows that in average, waiting time exceeds 40% the expected time &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{T}/2\)&lt;/code&gt;. That is: due to the variance in times between buses, you (and me) end up waiting a time greater than the average time between buses. And that is my feeling: if trains/buses come each 15 minutes, I end up waiting 15 minutes, not 7.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a ideal world, bus timetables would quote both the frequency of the buses &lt;code&gt;\(\overline{T}\)&lt;/code&gt; and their variance &lt;code&gt;\(\sigma_T\)&lt;/code&gt;, so we can estimate the waiting time. Unfortunately, they just tell us part of the story&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Robert_Brown_%28young_-_larousse%29.jpg/397px-Robert_Brown_%28young_-_larousse%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1828, Robert Brown published the manuscript entitled &amp;ldquo;A brief account of microscopical observations made in the months of June, July and August 1827, on the particles contained in the pollen of plants; and on the general existence of active molecules in organic and inorganic bodies&amp;rdquo; in the Edinburgh new Philosophical Journal [download it in pdf format &lt;a href=&#34;http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/pdfs/dws/Brownian.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;]. He suspended some of the pollen grains of the species &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.robsplants.com/plants/ClarkPulch.php&#34;&gt;Clarkia pulchella&lt;/a&gt; in water and examined them closely, only to see them &amp;ldquo;filled with particles&amp;rdquo; of around 5 µm diameter that were &amp;ldquo;very evidently in motion&amp;rdquo;. He was soon satisfied that the movement &amp;ldquo;arose neither from currents in the fluid nor form its gradual evaporation, but belonged to the particle itself&amp;rdquo;. Brown&amp;rsquo;s work was the first comprehensive observation of a phenomena called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion&#34;&gt;Brownian motion&lt;/a&gt; which remained unexplained until the beginning of the 20th century by Bachelier and most notably by Einstein in his famous paper in 1905. Brownian motion is the most basic description of the dynamics of a particle, price, etc. under the influence of external noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical mistake found in books, encyclopedias and articles (even in the Nature journal and even by the great &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7023/full/433221a.html&#34;&gt;Giorgio Parisi&lt;/a&gt;) is that Brown observed the motion of the pollen grains themselves. This might be the most clear example of a propagated mistake in the scientific literature, since it is obvious from the very title that the particles he observed were &amp;ldquo;in the pollen grains&amp;rdquo;. In fact, using the explanation of the motion by Einstein is easy to convince ourselves that the pollen grains were too big to wander around enough to be observable: Einstein in 1905 published a paper (original &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/History/Einstein1906BMII.pdf&#34;&gt;in german&lt;/a&gt;) in which he derived the famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory)&#34;&gt;Einstein relation&lt;/a&gt; in kinetic theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$D = \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta r}$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which relates the diffusion constant of the Brownian motion of a particle &lt;code&gt;\(D\)&lt;/code&gt; with the radius of the particle &lt;code&gt;\(r\)&lt;/code&gt; and the viscosity of the medium in which the particle is moving &lt;code&gt;\(\eta\)&lt;/code&gt;. The diffusion constant &lt;code&gt;\(D\)&lt;/code&gt; is also proportional to the temperature &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\(k_B\)&lt;/code&gt; is the Boltzmann constant. In order to observe the motion by eye, the particle should move considerably in a matter of seconds. We can evaluate the size of the movement by looking at the root-mean-square fluctuations in the position which are given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\langle x^2(t)\rangle = D t$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a pollen grain the radius is around &lt;code&gt;\(\simeq 100 \mu m\)&lt;/code&gt; and in water at &lt;code&gt;\(T =\)&lt;/code&gt; 25ºC we get that &lt;code&gt;\(\langle x^2(t)\rangle = 19 \mu m\)&lt;/code&gt; in &amp;hellip; one day!! This slow pace motion is hard to observe with today optical microscopes by eye, not to say with the microscope used by Brown (see the above picture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To observe the Brownian motion by eye, the particles should be smaller. If we assume that the radius should be small enough so that the RMS fluctuations in one second are greater or of the order of the particle size, we get that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$r \leq 1 \mu m$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that is, of the same length of the particles observed by Brown inside the pollen grain. In the following video you can see this molecular motion in an experiment made a research group in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Luis Dinis, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucm.es/info/goptic/&#34;&gt;Julio Serna&lt;/a&gt;, Rodrigo Soto and Ricardo Brito) using polystyrene spheres of &lt;code&gt;\(0.75-0.89\mu m\)&lt;/code&gt; diameter in water. The observations are made with an optical microscope using a 60x objective. The Brownian motion is evident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing bad letters of recommendation: the story of Bachelier and Lévy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Take a coin and toss it a number &lt;code&gt;\(N\)&lt;/code&gt; of times in a time interval of duration &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;. Suppose that every time you get head you win &lt;code&gt;\(a\)&lt;/code&gt; euros and that you lose the same amount of money when you get tail. Then your capital is a random process with ups and dows like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
![](/img/posts/figurebachelier.jpg)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is a stochastic process usually called &amp;ldquo;Random Walk&amp;rdquo; and its properties depend on the parameters $N, a $ and &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt;. For example: if we play this game several times, the average mean value of the capital obtained after a time &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; is zero! This is simple to realize since the probability to get either head or tails is the same. The problem comes when you analyze the fluctuations around this zero gain: the variance of the deviations from this zero mean behavior go like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ Var(N) = N a^2 $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which brings the sad conclusion that the more times you play the game the higher the fluctuations are. If you are risk-averse, this is the worst situation since, although in average you don&amp;rsquo;t lose or win, the uncertanty of what quantity you will get in one shot of the game is growing in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now ask the following question: do the properties of this game change if we play &lt;code&gt;\(M &amp;gt; N\)&lt;/code&gt; times in the same time &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; with a smaller payoff &lt;code&gt;\(b&amp;lt;a\)&lt;/code&gt;? Of course the stochastic process change, but some of the properties remain unchanged under proper choices of &lt;code&gt;\(a\)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\(b\)&lt;/code&gt;. Obviously the average gain of this new game is also zero. What about the RMS? Note that if we take &lt;code&gt;\(a^2=T/N\)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\(b^2 = T/M\)&lt;/code&gt; then we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\(Var(N) = N a^2 = T\)&lt;/code&gt; for the first game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\(Var(M)  =M b^2 = T\)&lt;/code&gt; for the second game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is independent of the payoff. This fact led some mathematicians early last century to study the asymptotic case &lt;code&gt;\(a\to 0\)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\(N \to \infty\)&lt;/code&gt;, BUT taking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$a^2 N = T = constant \qquad (1)$$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which usually called Brownian Motion. The name &amp;ldquo;Brownian&amp;rdquo; comes from the botanist Brown who observed how particles of (probably) &lt;a href=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/2008/12/browns-observations-on-brownian-motion/&#34;&gt;clay moved in water under the kicks of the molecules of water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://estebanmoro.org/img/posts/louis_bachellier.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bachelier (1870-1946 right) was the first one to study the Brownian motion in his PhD thesis at the Sorbonne in Paris and applied it as a possible model for the stock market. He was well ahead of his time not only for its application to the stock market, but also because he derived a lot of the properties of this stochastic process. Unfortunately his notation was a little bit sloppy. In particular, the dependence of &lt;code&gt;\(a^2\)&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;\(N\)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\(T\)&lt;/code&gt; [given by equation (1) above] in the limit &lt;code&gt;\(N\to\infty\)&lt;/code&gt; was omitted in most of his books and papers but always assumed by Bachelier. This &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; omission and a careless reading of Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s work was the origin of Paul Lévy&amp;rsquo;s strong criticism to his work. It was so strong, that Levy wrote a very critical and negative report about Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s work when the latter was trying to get an appointment at Dijon. Bachelier of course didn&amp;rsquo;t get the position and moved then to a small university at Besançon and kept on working without much impact in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was after Kolmogorov&amp;rsquo;s 1931 citation of Bachelier work that Lévy went back to his work and realized that he made a misjudgment of Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s work. Apparently Levy didn&amp;rsquo;t even read Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s papers and books in the very first place and, even so, he disregarded Bachelier&amp;rsquo;s findings as erroneous. Quite a strange behavior for one of the best mathematicians of all times. After that, in 1931, Lévy wrote to Bachelier a letter apologizing for his behavior. It was a little bit late since Bachelier retired in 1937 although Bachelier was quite happy to receive Lévy&amp;rsquo;s letter. At last his work was read by someone, and by the best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
We present numerical schemes to integrate stochastic partial differential equations which describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of reaction-diffusion problems under the effect of internal fluctuations. The schemes conserve the non-negativity of the solutions and incorporate the Poissonian nature of internal fluctuations at small densities, their performance being limited by the level of approximation of density fluctuations at small scales. We apply the schemes to two different aspects of the Reggeon model, namely, the study of its nonequilibrium phase transition and the dynamics of fluctuating pulled fronts. In the latter case, our approach allows us to reproduce microscopic properties quantitatively within the continuum model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
We study the propagation of pulled fronts in the &lt;code&gt;\(A\leftrightarrow A+A\)&lt;/code&gt; microscopic reaction-diffusion process using Monte Carlo simulations. In the mean field approximation the process is described by the deterministic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov equation. In particular, we concentrate on the corrections to the deterministic behavior due to the number of particles per correlated volume &lt;code&gt;\(\Omega\)&lt;/code&gt;. By means of a hybrid simulation scheme, we manage to reach large macroscopic values of &lt;code&gt;\(\Omega\)&lt;/code&gt;, which allows us to show the importance in the dynamics of microscopic pulled fronts of the interplay of microscopic fluctuations and their macroscopic relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We study the emergence and dynamics of pulled fronts described by the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov (FKPP) equation in the microscopic reaction-diffusion process &lt;code&gt;\(A\leftrightarrow A+A\)&lt;/code&gt; on the lattice when only a particle is allowed per site. To this end we identify the parameter that controls the strength of internal fluctuations in this model, namely, the number of particles per correlated volume. When internal fluctuations are suppressed, we explictly see the matching between the deterministic FKPP description and the microscopic particle model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
We study numerically and analytically the dynamics of defect formation during a finite-time quench of the two-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg (SH) model of Rayleigh-Bénard convection. We find that the Kibble-Zurek picture of defect formation can be applied to describe the density of defects produced during the quench. Our study reveals the relevance of two factors: the effect of local variations of the striped patterns within defect-free domains and the presence of both pointlike and extended defects. Taking into account these two aspects we are able to identify the characteristic length scale selected during the quench and to relate it to the density of defects. We discuss possible consequences of our study for the analysis of the coarsening process of the SH model.&lt;/p&gt;

We study the diffusion-limited reaction &lt;code&gt;\(A \leftrightarrow A = A\)&lt;/code&gt; in various spatial dimensions to observe the effect of internal fluctuations on the interface between stable and unstable phases. We find that, similar to what has been observed in d = 1 dimensions, internal fluctuations modify the mean-field predictions for this process, which is given by Fisher’s reaction-diffusion equation. In d &amp;gt; 1 the front displays local fluctuations perpendicular to the direction of motion which, with a proper definition of the interface, can be fully described within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. This clarifies the apparent discrepancies with KPZ predictions reported recently.&lt;/p&gt;
